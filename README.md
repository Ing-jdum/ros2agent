# ROS2-Agent

This project explores the integration of generative AI within the field of robotics, leveraging the ROS2 framework. Created as a complementary component of my Masterâ€™s Thesis in Computational Logic and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Seville, it aims to push the boundaries of how AI can enhance robotic systems. While not intended as a comprehensive framework and not slated for ongoing maintenance, this project demonstrates innovative approaches and serves as a valuable proof of concept.



## Installation

To deploy this project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **ROS 2 Humble**: Follow the [ROS 2 Humble Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) to set up ROS 2.
2. **Plansys2**: Install Plansys2 by following the [Plansys2 Build Instructions](https://plansys2.github.io/build_instructions/index.html).
3. **Nav2 Stack**
4. **TurtleBot3**

### Important Note on Nav2 and TurtleBot3
Due to known issues with DDS and configuration settings for `robot_model_type` in Nav2, we recommend watching [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idQb2pB-h2Q&ab_channel=RoboticsBack-End) by Robotics Back-End. This tutorial provides solutions and workarounds for setup bugs that may occur with Nav2 and TurtleBot3.

### Modifying Plansys2 for TCP Connections

1. To enable TCP connections, replace the `plansys2_terminal` package within the Plansys2 library.
   - Copy the file from the repository directory [`plansys2_packages_changes/plansys2_terminal`](path-to-your-repository/plansys2_packages_changes/plansys2_terminal) and paste it into your Plansys2 workspace, typically found at:
     ```plaintext
     plansys2ws/src/ros2_planning_system
     ```

2. Once the file is in place, build the modified package by running the following command in your Plansys2 workspace:
   ```bash
   colcon build --packages-select plansys2_terminal --symlink-install
## Deployment

To run this project, you will need to open four terminals. We recommend using [Terminator](https://gnome-terminator.org/) to manage multiple terminal windows efficiently.

### Terminal Setup

1. **Deploy the Simulation**
   - In the first terminal, navigate to your Plansys2 workspace and launch the simulation:
     ```bash
     ros2 launch workshop_plansys2 workshop.launch.py  
     ```

2. **Deploy the Nav2 Stack**
   - In the second terminal, launch the Nav2 stack, passing the paths to your `map.yaml` and `nav2_params.yaml` files as parameters:
     ```bash
     ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py use_sim_time:=True map:=<your clone location>/maps/workshop.yaml params_file:=<your plansys2 workspace>/src/workshop_plansys2/params/nav2_params.yaml  
     ```
   - This will open the RVIZ application. Once it loads, provide the initial pose 2D estimate for the robot.

3. **Launch the Plansys2 Controller**
   - In the third terminal, navigate to plansys2 workspace and run the Plansys2 controller:
     ```bash
     ros2 launch workshop_plansys2 plansys2_bt_example_launch.py  
     ```

4. **Run the Plansys2 Terminal**
   - In the fourth terminal, navigate to plansys2 workspace and start the Plansys2 terminal:
     ```bash 
     ros2 run plansys2_terminal plansys2_terminal
     ```

5. **Execute the Python Main Script**
   - Finally, in another terminal, or an ide, run your main Python script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

Once all terminals are set up, the project should be fully deployed and operational. You can communicate with the robot through the terminal with the python application.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file, you can rename the file '.env_template'

`OPENAI_API_KEY`
